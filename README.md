# Shell-Program
On this project I created a shell bash console that support most of the bash commands,
Each command is printed with its process number.
A program that supports parallel processes using the '&' at the end of the command.
Examples of commands can be executed:
1. ls.
2. pwd.
3. man.
4. cd.
5. sleep.
etc, each command can be executed with the '&' sign.
